Blockchain technology allows new businesses and organizations to form and self-organize, raise funds, create value and manage their infrastructure in radically new ways. 

Blockchains are a techno-social Black Swan Event, challenging fundamental assumptions behind contemporary legislation. Businesses and not-for-profit organizations based on or interfacing with blockchains face countless legal insecurities. At the same time, blockchains can bolster trust even for existing legal processes.
