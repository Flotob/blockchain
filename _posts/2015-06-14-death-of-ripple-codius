In order to understand the purpose that Codius was intended to serve in the wider Blockchain ecosystem, one has to understand the systemic limitations of the latter. For all the security that Blockchains are able to generate through their crypto-economic governance and incentive scheme, they suffer from inherent slowness when it comes to general-purpose computation[2], as well as from an inherent blindness when it comes to incorporating rich information about the outside world.

This is where Codius’ complementary infrastructure decisions unfold their beneficial value to Blockchain-driven networks. Whereas Blockchains are good at delivering global consensus among thousands to millions of nodes, Codius’ solution is intended to deliver local consensus relevant only to specific individuals.[3]

The affordances of local consensus schemes lie mainly in two areas: <i>Computational Complexity and Data Richness.</i>
