           Distributed Ledger Technology aka Blockchain is gaining recognition in both private and public sectors. The peer-to-peer technology promises to disintermediate, streamline and standardize processes across a wide range of industries and public service offerings. Although a key innovation of Blockchain Technology is the sophisticated level of self-governance it enables, the technology needs to be recognized by national and international laws and regulations to go from fringe to mainstream. At the same time, Blockchain-based applications and services need to incorporate an understanding of relevant legal norms into their codified rulesets.
           <br/><br/>
           How can we combine the empowering properties of distributed ledgers with the legal tools and frameworks our society has evolved?
